# COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Convolutional and Generative models

## Introduction
--------------

In this project I aim to develop a neural network architecture consiting of Convolutional Variational Autoencoder and Temporal Convolutional cluster for identifying COVID-19 from CT, X-ray and other demographics data.

## Dataset
-------

I'm using dataset which is publicaly available at [this repository ](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset). It contains images of CT scans , X-rays mined from various websites. The dataset is only being used for research pueposes and soley belongs to the linked repository.

## Organization

## Progress
------------

Current Goal : 
1) Data extraction
2) Data preprocessing
