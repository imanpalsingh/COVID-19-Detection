# COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Convolutional and Generative models

## Introduction


In this project I aim to develop a neural network architecture consisting of Convolutional Variational Autoencoder and Temporal Convolutional cluster for identifying COVID-19 from CT, X-ray and other demographics data.

## Dataset


I'm using dataset which is publicly available at [this repository ](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset). It contains images of CT scans , X-rays mined from various websites. The dataset is only being used for research purposes and  belongs to the linked repository.

## Organization

```
root/
    /src (will be added)
    /Dataset (added to .gitignore)
```

## Progress

Current Goal : 
1) Data extraction
2) Data preprocessing
